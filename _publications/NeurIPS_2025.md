title: "With Limited Data for Multimodal Alignment, Let the STRUCTURE Guide You."
collection: publications
excerpt: 'STRUCTURE is a framework for building multimodal models in low-data regimes by aligning frozen unimodal foundation models, enabling strong performance on zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks. It introduces a simple, plug-and-play regularization technique that preserves the geometric structure of each modality’s latent space and aligns layers with the highest representational similarity across modalities.'
