Single-cell technologies such as transcriptomics, microscopy, and flow cytometry have revolutionized the study of cellular identity and function. While each of these technologies is powerful on its own, their full potential lies in their integration, enabling multimodal profiling of the same cell and revealing how distinct modalities influence one another. Here, we introduce IRIS (Interconnected Robotic Imaging and Single cell transcriptomics), a deterministic single-cell platform technology that seamlessly couples high-resolution microscopy with droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing. IRIS enables precise cell positioning, multimode imaging across brightfield and fluorescent channels, and subsequent molecular capture from the same cell, directly linking high-resolution morphological features to matched transcriptomes. We validate IRIS by recovering cell cycle progression states and transcriptional programmes associated with canonical morphologies and demonstrate its discovery power by molecularly resolving two nuclear-ER architectures within naïve CD8+ T cells, each defined by distinct gene expression profiles and functional markers. IRIS establishes an integrative single-cell phenomics framework, opening new avenues for dissecting how cellular form relates to molecular state and function.
