title: "Single-cell phenomics through integrated imaging and molecular profiling"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'We introduce IRIS (Interconnected Robotic Imaging and Single-cell transcriptomics), a deterministic single-cell platform that couples high-resolution microscopy with droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq to capture multimodal images and matched transcriptomes from the same cell, directly linking morphology to gene expression.'
