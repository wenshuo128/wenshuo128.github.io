Hello, I am Shuo Wen, a second-year computer science PhD student in [MLBio lab](https://brbiclab.epfl.ch/) at EPFL. Currently, I am working on the application of foundation models in biology and images advised by Prof. Maria Brbic.

Prior to my PhD, I received my master's degree from EPFL and my bachelor's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

You can reach me at shuo.wen@epfl.ch.
